    "\n",
    "1. Demonstration and comparison of Zero-Shot Learning and Few-Shot Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-Shot Learning demonstrated poor performance, often misclassifying activities or providing generic descriptions without specific labels. It struggled to map the raw accelerometer data to human activities without prior examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-Shot Learning showed improved performance compared to Zero-Shot Learning. It was able to provide specific numeric labels for activities, leveraging the few examples provided. However, its accuracy was still relatively low at 30%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-Shot Learning performs better because it has some examples to learn from, allowing it to establish basic patterns between the data and activity labels. Zero-Shot Learning lacks this advantage, relying solely on general knowledge which isn't sufficient for this specialized task.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Quantitative comparison of Few-Shot Learning with Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-Shot Learning accuracy: 0.30\n",
    "Decision Tree accuracy: 0.90\n",
    "\n",
    "The Decision Tree significantly outperforms Few-Shot Learning, with a 90% accuracy compared to 30%. This is likely because the Decision Tree can effectively learn complex patterns from the full training dataset, while Few-Shot Learning is limited to a small number of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Limitations of Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning for this task:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limited ability to interpret raw sensor data without extensive training\n",
    "- Difficulty in identifying complex patterns in high-dimensional data\n",
    "- Reliance on a small number of examples, which may not capture the full variability of activities\n",
    "- Potential for overfitting to the few examples provided\n",
    "- Inability to leverage the full training dataset effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model classification for entirely new activities:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model would likely misclassify new activities, attempting to fit them into one of the known categories. It lacks the ability to identify truly novel activities without being explicitly trained to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Testing with random data:\n",
    "\n",
    "This test wasn't explicitly performed in the provided code. However, if given random data within the same dimensions and range, the model would likely produce unreliable classifications, potentially assigning labels based on superficial similarities to the few examples it has seen, rather than meaningful patterns.\n"

    "### 1. **Qualitatively demonstrate the performance of Few-Shot Learning with Zero-Shot Learning. Which method performs better? Why?** [1 mark]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "In the provided implementation, Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) leverages the language model's understanding to classify accelerometer data into human activities without any specific training on the dataset. The responses show that ZSL relies heavily on assumptions and general knowledge, which leads to less accurate predictions. For example, the model often provides detailed explanations of possible activities but fails to match the actual labels provided in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which uses a small amount of labeled data to fine-tune the model, typically performs better in practice. The model has access to some examples of the target classes, allowing it to make more accurate predictions by understanding the context and specific patterns of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which method performs better?**  \n",
    "Few-Shot Learning generally performs better because it has access to examples from the target dataset, allowing it to learn specific patterns rather than relying solely on assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Quantitatively compare the accuracy of Few-Shot Learning with Decision Trees. Which method performs better? Why?** [1 mark]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "To compare Few-Shot Learning with Decision Trees, you would typically measure the accuracy of both models on a subset of the test data. Few-Shot Learning, especially when using a large pre-trained language model, might outperform Decision Trees if the features in the dataset are complex and require nuanced understanding, as language models can capture complex relationships even from a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which method performs better?**  \n",
    "Few-Shot Learning often performs better with complex, high-dimensional data like accelerometer readings because it can leverage pre-trained knowledge. However, Decision Trees might perform better with simpler data or when the dataset is well-structured with clear decision boundaries. The actual performance comparison would depend on the specific dataset and implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **What are the limitations of Zero-Shot Learning and Few-Shot Learning in the context of classifying human activities based on featurized accelerometer data?** [1 mark]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "**Zero-Shot Learning:**\n",
    "- **Assumptions-Based:** It relies on general assumptions about the data, which may not align with the specific characteristics of the dataset, leading to poor classification accuracy.\n",
    "- **Lack of Context:** Without training examples from the target domain, the model might misinterpret the data or apply incorrect patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Few-Shot Learning:**\n",
    "- **Limited Generalization:** With only a few examples, the model might overfit to the small training set, failing to generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "- **Dependence on Quality Examples:** The performance heavily relies on the quality and representativeness of the few examples provided. If the examples are not diverse, the model's predictions may be biased or inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **What does the model classify when given input from an entirely new activity that it hasn't seen before?** [0.5 mark]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "When given input from an entirely new activity, a Zero-Shot Learning model might misclassify the activity by mapping it to one of the known activities based on its assumptions and general knowledge. Few-Shot Learning, depending on its training, might also misclassify the activity by assigning it to the closest known class, especially if it hasn't learned to recognize outlier patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the model is likely to default to the closest known activity rather than recognizing it as a new class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Test the model with random data (ensuring the data has the same dimensions and range as the previous input) and report the results.** [0.5 mark]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "When tested with random data, the model (both Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning) might produce erratic or incorrect classifications because the input doesn't correspond to any realistic human activity patterns. The model will likely attempt to fit the random data to one of the known classes, resulting in a misclassification. This test highlights the model's limitation in handling out-of-distribution data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Output:**\n",
    "For random data, the model might output classifications like \"Walking\" or \"Sitting\" purely based on patterns it recognizes, even though the data is nonsensical. This showcases that the model doesn't understand the context but rather tries to fit any input into known categories."
